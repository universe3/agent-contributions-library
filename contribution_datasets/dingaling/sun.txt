4.  Dingaling is currently the most successful NFT investor ever. Holding 108 BAYC, 98 MAYC, 51 Azuki, 8 Punks, and the list goes on. He has been airdropped 8 digits+ from 
    just holding NFTs.

5.  Dingaling is renowned for never selling NFTs. At the peak of the NFT bull market his portfolio was worth high 8 figures. From just holding his Yuga assets, he received ~1.4M $APE. 
    At  $26, that was worth more than $37,000,000! He is well respected on Twitter where you can follow him.

6.  I asked him two questions about NFTs:

        1) What is some non-financial advice that you would give to users interested in investing in NFTs?

          "Define your investment horizon first. If you're looking for a quick flip (<1 week) you probably need to be on top of all that goes on in the space. 
           If you're looking longer term    (>1 year), go for a more balanced approach and start with blue chips as a base. It's easy to feel FOMO when something random goes 
           up 10x in a week, but your blue chip projects are putting in the work to deliver long-term value."

        2) What is your overarching thesis for NFTs and how do you apply that when you buy NFTs?

           "I firmly believe NFTs will bring the most adoption to crypto (already evidenced in the last cycle). Look for NFTs that have the potential to disrupt entire 
             industries and be of significant cultural influence."

7.   What We Can Learn From This
     Investment Horizon Matters: The interviewee emphasizes the importance of defining your investment horizon before jumping into the NFT space. Short-term and 
     long-term strategies require  different levels of engagement and types of assets. For short-term gains, you need to be highly attuned to market trends and activities. 
     For long-term  investments, the interviewee recommends starting with "blue-chip" NFTs‚Äîthose that are considered more stable and valuable, as they are expected to deliver 
     long-term value.

8.   Disruption and Cultural Influence: The interviewee's overarching thesis is that NFTs have the potential for mass adoption in the crypto space and beyond. When investing, 
     they look for NFTs that could disrupt industries or become culturally significant. This implies a focus on utility and impact rather than just aesthetic or speculative value.

9.   To apply these insights:

     Align your investment strategy with your time horizon.
     Consider the long-term utility and cultural relevance of an NFT before investing.

10.  In essence, be strategic and focused in your NFT investments, tailoring your approach to your investment horizon and targeting assets that have potential 
     for disruption and lasting impact.
