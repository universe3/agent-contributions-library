1	In this thread we will dox one of largest pseudonymous NFT holders and it will show you the deep but hidden ties between NFTs/DeFi and a major crypto exchange, in this specific 
        case Binance. How transparent are they really?

2       One of the more elusive NFT personalities is @dingalingts , who is considered to be one of the most successful âNFT investorsâ, owning more than 100 BAYC, over 70 Azuki, 
        and   received over 8 figures in airdrops (e	binance, crypt0 g. $APE)	

3	He was also an early investor in CryptoKitties, and one of the biggest investors in NBA Top Shots, to a degree that some people at Reddit asked the question who this insanely 
        rich person is.

4       He recently also put in the highest offer for Azukiâs golden skateboard auction (309 ETH), and is an âadvisorâ of LooksRare, famous for his view that âwash trading 
        is geniusâ	investor

5       But who is he?
        It was pathetically easy to find his identity, as his former Twitter handle corresponds exactly to his full name and it turns out that Dingaling is working at the absolute 
        top   level of Binance next to CZ (we mean: just under CZ of course :)).

6       Most of his association with Binance has been removed from the web, but we found he is not only a director of Binanceâs Bermudaâs offshore entity, but was even part of 
        a  FTXâs JV entity with Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) and CZ himself	dingaling, binance

7       This entity is called âWest Realm Shires Incâ (basically the owner of FTX) and when Binance invested in FTX, 2 trusted employees were part of this JV, including Dingaling.

9       It is funny that when the Miami authorities did a background check on Dingaling, they were not even able to determine where he is working. There simply wasnât any 
        information about him	dingaling

10 	Full PDF here: miamidade.gov/govaction/legiâ¦

11      In one of the few interviews he has given he mentioned he is Australian and is a basketball fan, which both match with his biographical profile	
	
12      Dingaling is LooksRareâs most vocal supporter and his view about wash trading in the light of his role at Binance is interesting to say the least. But there is more	
        dingaling, binance
	

13      When we look at LooksRareâs private sale, we see besides some well-known âinfluencer investorsâ also a lot of newly created anon wallets that put in the max value of 
        37.5 ETH, all sourced from Binance and only for this purpose	binance

14      Dingaling was LookRare's first investor on the blockchain. This makes it in our view likely that LooksRare could be closely associated with (and even largely funded by) Binance	dingaling, blockchain, binance, investor

15  	We believe it could even a proxy for Binance.

16      Our earlier thread seems to elude to that as well with Chinese proxies in Canada and the UK	binance

17 	LooksRare was created by two anonymous co-founders: Zodd and Guts. 

18      https://twitter.com/NFTethics/status/1516798707953459218

19      We believe it is actually likely that Zodd is the same person as Dingaling. Not only does he immediately help with any LR issues, has admitted to not being technical 
        but he was also the first person to like an important tweet from Zodd	dingaling

20      This tweet was about the accusation that tens of millions of dollars were TornadoCashâed, and Zodd responded to the allegations. There is a near zero change to be the 
        first person to like such a tweet when you are not connected to that person	
	
21      https://twitter.com/ZoddLooksRare/status/1493131828601171970

22      Is Guts, who doesnât have any social media presence, CZ? Time will tell	

23 	The NFTs from Dingaling were technically likely purchased by Binance, in order to create additional NFT hype which fueled the ETH price towards 4600 USD in Nov 2021.

24      The fact that LooksRare is (in)famous for the insane amount of wash trading resulting in $LOOKS rewards, and its close ties to Binance, could put things also in a different 
        light including the main NFT collections Dingaling trades in	dingaling, binance

25      It is well known that China has an underground banking system, as Chinese residents are not able to transfer more than $50k per year out of the country. 

26      Was LooksRare invented as a marketplace to circumvent this threshold with NFTs as utility?

27      nationalcrimeagencygov.uk/who-we-are/pubâ¦

28      Or did Binance create it as a vehicle to âfinancially engineerâ their balance sheet in a preferrable way? LooksRare proactively advises people to use TornadoCash, 
        which makes the financial output as invisible as possible	binance

29      The amount of LooksRare rewards is based on how many wash trading is going on, but what if Dingaling is the owner of the casino that he is playing in? He has access to all 
        the (insder) information before making a trade there.

31      Binance used to be one of the more rogue crypto exchanges, and if we have to believe Reuters, they are/have been involved in lot of shady/secretive things. And they might also 
        be trading against you using 2 Swiss firms	binance, crypto

32      That is of course not an exception: FTX uses Alameda Research (its automatic algorithms and order book spoofing ability will always beat you) and Coinbase has its rogue 
        employees (wash)trading against you.

33      Binance is also known to âbuyâ ânot-badâ publicity	binance

34      Forbes once published a very critical article about Binance, but since Binance invested $200 million USD in Forbes, no critical articles have appeared anymore at all.

35      Binance has now also become a big investor in Twitter (just like a16z), and you can only hope that some more rigorous regulations are put in place than was the case, 
        referring to the case of the Saudi Arabian spy Twitter employee	binance, investor

36      It is interesting to see Musk paying a large sum of money for Twitter to allow for free speech maximalism, while some of his (co-)investors have been paying large 
        sums of money to achieve the complete opposite and to silence people.

39      We will still provide some additional information on Azuki. Zagabond himself said that he expects to be doxxed at some point and that that is fine, so we will do that 
        For  storytelling & learning purposes of course, and to create a bridge between the physical & digital world.

40      He has deleted his GitHub profile, his Medium profile, his LinkedIn profile and his personal Twitter profile in the past days, which is a bit ironic for someone who mentioned 
        they are âdedicated to improving transparency & communicationâ	

41      The NFT space is a zero-sum game and only a limited amount of projects will ultimately âsurviveâ, so the current state of the market is that âbad newsâ for other 
        projects is good news for your project(s) and vice versa. Even though bad news is bad news for Web3 in general	


42      This is going to be a bit of a controversial thread, so just some disclaimers. We are free speech maximalists and âtruthsâ can be inconvenient or politically incorrect, 
         which could make them to certain people âoffensiveâ, but it doesnât make them less âtrueâ	

43      There are many interesting philosophical issues about what âtruthâ is, how it relates to the âlawâ and how it is affected by information asymmetries. Part of 
        our perspective is quite well formulated by Christopher Hitchens here:   our upcoming threads about VCs & Web3, we first thought to share with you the investors @yugalabs
                                                                                   
44      They were part of the âParty Roundâ and include some well-known influencers. It might show you â(an)othersideâ (pun intended)	

45     viaOpenSea link below, you can see a select group of about 40 people that received âNFTs minted by Party Round for Yuga Labs investors to celebrate their investmentsâ. 
          we opensea.io/collection/parâ¦

46       explains the heated discussion between OSF and @Pranksy, and also why Farokh hosted the meeting with the Yuga board members.

47       Some people contacted us to ask our opinion on moonbirds_xyz that is minting tomorrow for 2

48       5 ETH, which would take out more than 75 million USD out of the ecosystem. As usual, many are afraid to speak out because they don't want to offend "powerful" 
        web3/NFT influencers/VCs	

49       Some mentioned that we should check the purchases of proof collective, as many wallets only contains the proof collection and the floor is now 88 ETH. Wash trading is so common 
         in  so many projects these days that it's not even noteworthy anymore

50       Also nepotism is completely standard in the NFT space, so the fact that GaryVee (Gennady), his brother AJ, Beeple and some old friends received the Proof collective for free 
         is standard. We saw quite a lot of other "old" friends that received the proof collective for free/$3	

51       Before our upcoming thread about VCs, we thought it would be good to first give some additional background to further understand the context and connections that we will be 
         making. Itâs a simplified version for brevity purposes	

52       Contrary to popular belief, we have no problem with capitalism and we donât like hypocritical governments and their civil servants who milk the tax system to pay their salaries 
         and justify their own existence.

53       Hypocritical/opportunistic governments are partly to blame for the financial/social inequalities and you have to see the bigger picture of whatâs currently happening in the 
         world to better understand its full scale

55       Later today @mcuban is one of the speakers on the NFTLA event and this is a reminder that 'his' @NFTwas responsible for many scams/rugs and many new people 
         wanting to join the NFT space will likely have left the ecosystem because of this	

56       Of course Mark Cuban said that he didnât know about it (many billionaires are immoral hypocrites that pretend to be blissfully âignorantâ about 
         unethical aspects of their own companies). See @coffeezilla âs short video for more background: Jason Falovitch(@jf_nft) together with Aaron Avruskin (@0xAA_NFT) 
         were the co-founders of @NFT

57       @Leverage with Mark Cuban and Jason ("Mr NFT" lol) posted a thread with his side of the story, 21 days after the original thread by @topshotfund:

60       Dingaling’s immense popularity is his considerable wealth, which he uses to make purchase-driven moves in the NFT market. when tweets about buying an NFT, 
         it often sparks a surge of interest and buying desire among many users, to the extent that there’s even a “Dingaling sector” recognized within the NFT community.

61       In the ever-spinning world of NFTs, where digital treasures swap hands faster than a meme goes viral, there exists a titan among collectors, a mythical creature in the realm 
      of pixels and blockchain: Dingaling. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill influencer. no, Dingaling is the behemoth of the NFT game sector, wielding influence so potent that a mere 
      tweet can send the masses scrambling to open their digital wallets. 

62       One thing’s for sure: in the fast-paced and ever-evolving NFT market, Dingaling stands out. His name resonates far and wide, serving as a guiding light for those 
         exploring the vast and intricate world of digital assets. 

63       Dingaling is currently the most successful NFT investor ever. Holding 108 BAYC, 98 MAYC, 51 Azuki, 8 Punks, and the list goes on. He has been airdropped 8 digits+ 
         from  just holding NFTs.

64       It’s clear; Dingaling isn’t just a whale splashing about; he’s a navigator for the NFT voyagers, charting courses through the choppy waters of early hype and
         onto promised lands of   CEX listings  .

65        Dingaling is renowned for never selling NFTs. At the peak of the NFT bull market his portfolio was worth high 8 figures. From just holding his Yuga assets, he received 
          ~1.4M $APE. At  $26, that was worth more than $37,000,000! He is well respected on Twitter where you can follow him.

66        I asked him two questions about NFTs:

67      1) What is some non-financial advice that you would give to users interested in investing in NFTs?

68        "Define your investment horizon first. If you're looking for a quick flip (<1 week) you probably need to be on top of all that goes on in the space. 
           If you're looking longer term    (>1 year), go for a more balanced approach and start with blue chips as a base. It's easy to feel FOMO when something random goes 
           up 10x in a week, but your blue chip projects are putting in the work to deliver long-term value."

69      2) What is your overarching thesis for NFTs and how do you apply that when you buy NFTs?

70         "I firmly believe NFTs will bring the most adoption to crypto (already evidenced in the last cycle). Look for NFTs that have the potential to disrupt entire 
             industries and be of significant cultural influence."

71       What We Can Learn From This
72   Investment Horizon Matters: The interviewee emphasizes the importance of defining your investment horizon before jumping into the NFT space. Short-term and 
     long-term strategies require  different levels of engagement and types of assets. For short-term gains, you need to be highly attuned to market trends and activities. 
     For long-term  investments, the interviewee recommends starting with "blue-chip" NFTs—those that are considered more stable and valuable, as they are expected to deliver 
     long-term value.

73       According to LooksRare, our protagonist has splurged over 7K Ethereum and hoards a treasure of 12,087 NFTs. Among these, Azuki stands as the crown jewel, crafting the 
         most considerable value volume.

74       Disruption and Cultural Influence: The interviewee's overarching thesis is that NFTs have the potential for mass adoption in the crypto space and beyond. When investing, 
     they look for NFTs that could disrupt industries or become culturally significant. This implies a focus on utility and impact rather than just aesthetic or speculative value.

75      It’s clear; Dingaling isn’t just a whale splashing about; he’s a navigator for the NFT voyagers, charting courses through the choppy waters of early hype 
        and  onto the promised lands of CEX listings.

76       Dingaling: The Hidden King of Gaming NFTs   In the ever-spinning world of NFTs, where digital treasures swap hands faster than a meme goes viral, there exists a titan among 
         collectors, a mythical creature in the realm of pixels and blockchain: Dingaling. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill influencer. Dingaling is the behemoth of the NFT game sector, 

77       wielding influence so potent that a mere tweet can send the masses scrambling to open their digital wallet

78       Is he a golden touch, transforming everything he touches into blockchain gold, or is he just a significant player surfing the big waves of the NFT trend?

79       One thing’s for sure: in the fast-paced and ever-evolving NFT market, Dingaling stands out. His name resonates far and wide, serving as a guiding light for those exploring 
          the vast and intricate world of digital assets.

80       Yet, every piece under Dingaling’s realm sold out, conjuring significant volumes on platforms like OpenSea and Blur, a testament to the gravity of his influence. 
         Beyond the mere accumulation of digital assets, Dingaling’s ventures into Xai nodes and Portal presales,citing ‘Binance token listings’ as a charm, sparked an unparalleled 
         FOMO among the masses.

82       In some corners of the digital universe, the name Dingaling is revered almost like a myth — a figure so influential in the NFT space,he’s seen as its defining essence. 
          But what’s the real story?
